* Add system feedback - priority
* Seperate scalebar settings from the map settings - priority 
* Add custom line size incriments on the custom line color widget (currently inc is hard coded in)

* re-write the routine for font color buttons
* validate extents (make sure n>s and w>e,  etc) 
* remove seperate offset text values and place as a font property
* ensure reasonable default values for all custom controls (i.e. .25 gridlines vs 1.5 map frame, etc)
* can I combine political boundary types in one call or do they need to be called seperately?
